              As explained in the <a href="">theory section</a>, VHb can be used to increase the yield of proteins under oxygen-limited conditions. In this section, we present a review of some applications were the technology has proven itself useful. The practical benefits of VHb co-expression have been harnessed in order to increase the production of proteins [1][2] and growth of rice [3], maize [4] and the tobacco plant [5]. VHb can also be used in bioremediation of toxic compounds such as textile dyes [6] and aromatic compounds [7].

            <b>Enzymes</b>
            <p>
              β-galactosidase is an enzyme commonly used for removal of lactose from milk, which is required to make it drinkable for more than half of the world’s population [8]. Wu <i>et al.</i> [1] managed to increase the production of this enzyme by 9.9% under non-limiting aeration, proving the benefit of VHb co-expression. The host organism <i>Pichia pastoris</i> demonstrated an improvement of 28.2% in oxygen uptake rate when grown in shake flasks. Another industrial enzyme, ɑ-amylase, was also co-expressed with VHb [2]. An 18% increase of the enzyme concentration was noted when cultivated in a bioreactor under non-limiting aeration. This strengthens the argument that VHb can emit similar benefits when scaling up the process.

            <b>Plants</b>
            <p>
              Expression of VHb has also been studied in plants and shown to induce physiological changes. Wang <i>et al.</i> [9] managed to successfully integrate the VHb gene into <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, which resulted in multiple positive effects: substantially taller plants, faster generation time and increased resistance to flooding compared to the wild-type.
            </p>

            <p>
              Water-logging, where water saturates the roots of the plant, is a common issue in agriculture with about 6 to 10 million hectares of land affected in India alone [10]. In 2011, the average crop yield of rice, cereals and wheat in India was 2636 kg/hectare according to the Department of Agriculture & Cooperation [11]. To put this in perspective, 6 to 10 millions of hectares equals approximately 16 000 to 26 000 million kg of food affected by water-logging every year. VHb co-expression can be a viable solution to alleviate this issue, while also providing the additional benefit of increasing the biomass content of plants [5][12].

            <b>Bioremediation</b>
            <p>
              Contamination of soil and groundwater from pharmaceutical residues [13], petroleum [14], aromatic hydrocarbons [15], organic dyes [16], pesticides [17] and heavy metals [18] can lead to serious disorders in the domestic microbial flora [19] and human population [20]. Bioremediation is an environmentally friendly solution to this issue and is used to treat heavily contaminated sites [21]. A frequent issue during bioremediation is the lack of oxygen in the environment where it is taking place. VHb has been used in various bioremediation scenarios for exactly this reason.
            </p>

            <p>
              Kahraman and Geckil [7] proposed a potential solution to the problem by expressing VHb in yeast capable of using benzene, toluene and xylene as carbon sources. Hypoxic conditions were emulated by limiting the oxygen supply and a significant increase in degradation of the contaminants was observed.
            </p>

            <p>
              To prevent the release of genetically engineered bioremediating organisms into the environment, Urgun-Demirtas [22] used a membrane bioreactor commonly used in waste-water treatment. They studied the degradation of 2-chlorobenzoic acid by <i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> modified to express VHb. The transformed cells reached higher cell densities compared to their native counterparts, 3.2–5.4 g/L and 2.8–4.7 g/L respectively. Survivability in hypoxic oxygen concentrations also improved.

            <b>Biofuels</b>
            <p>
              CO2 emission is expected to increase by approximately 20% before 2035 according to the Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change [23]. Biofuels have become a feasible alternative to fossil-based fuels and more car owners are committing to the change. The consumption of biofuels, mainly ethanol, is predicted to rise from 1.3 barrels/day in 2011 to 4.1 barrels/day by 2035 [24]. In turn, the demand for more efficient biofuel production will increase.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ethanol makes up three fourths of biofuel use [24]. Until now it has been produced using cornstarch, sugar canes and sugar beets, however a cost-effective production of bioethanol will necessitate the development of alternative fermentation feedstocks and increased productivity [25]. Sanny <i>et al.</i> [26] and Arnaldos <i>et al.</i> [27] demonstrate that the expression of small amounts of VHb, despite of being counterintuitive for a fermentation process, resulted in a significant increase in ethanol production.
            </p>

            <p>
              The delivery of small amounts of oxygen to the bacteria have generated an increase in ethanol production in <i>E. coli</i> using feedstocks as diverse as glucose (30% increase) [26], xylose (119%) [26], corn stover hydrolysate (59%) [26], potato processing waste water (5-18%) [28], cheese whey (21-419%) [29] and whey powder (17-362%) [29] among others. VHb have also been shown to increase ethanol production in yeast [30]. Also investigators in Hong Kong have shown that its expression in <i>Aurantiochytrium sp.</i> enhanced the production of fatty acids that could be used as precursors of the synthesis of biodiesel [31].
