          <h3 class="section-heading">Overview</h3>
          <p>
            In this section we present and discuss the experimental plan we set up in order to test our idea of co-expressing vitreoscilla hemoglobin to increase protein yields. We chose to perform all experiments using the iGEM standard plasmids pSB1C3 and pSB1A3 and for the proof of concept we decided to use a green fluorescent protein (GFP). The purpose of this was two-fold. First, the protein is an excellent reporter as it is simple to detect. Secondly, the additional supply of oxygen provided by the hemoglobin should help the chromophore mature faster. This provides a second measure to quantify the presence and effect of the hemoglobin by measuring the initial transient of fluorescence.

          <h3 class="section-heading">Plasmid construction </h3>
          <p>
            Initially, we planned to order both the VHb constructs as well as the GFP construct directly from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). However, as the latter contained multiple repeated sequences, it could not be synthesized and we therefore decided to instead use Bba_J364000 that was provided in the iGEM distribution kit.
          </p>

          <p>
            The constructs from Fig. 1 were obtained and inserted into pSB1C3 using a combination of 3A-assembly, Gibson assembly and a standard digestion-ligation procedure. Initially, we used 3A-assembly following the protocol from the iGEM registry. However, with lack of results we modified the protocol slightly and proceeded with Gibson assembly and the standard digestion-ligation. The constructs in Fig. 2 were then built following the same path of trial and repeat.
          </p>

          <p>
            The final biobricks were characterized and confirmed directly via a combination of sequencing, agarose gel electrophoresis and colony pcr, as well as measuring GFP fluorescence and observing the red color originating from the hemoglobin in the cell pellet. During further analysis, as described below, biobricks were additionally confirmed by absorbance measurements and flow cytometry.

          <h3 class="section-heading">Batch cultivation</h3>
          <p>
            Batch cultivations were carried out in Erlenmeyer flasks under various conditions. Both Lysogeny broth (LB) and Terrific broth (TB) were used as means of growing the cells under varying nutritional conditions. The idea here was that while VHb enhances oxygen utilization, there might also be an interaction with respect to nutritional availability as an increased metabolic activity demands additional oxygen. Also one could argue the other way around in that that low nutrient conditions puts further stress on the cells, which might cause VHb to either deliver oxygen or act directly as an antioxidant. Finally, by talking to experts within the field of biopharmaceutical production as a part of our integrated practices, we were taught that while LB is an excellent and cheap media, TB is more commonly used within the industry as it generally yields higher cell densities. Obviously, the additional cost of having a more expensive media is heavily outweighed by the return of producing more valuable bioproducts.
          </p>

          <p>
            Further conditions that were modified includes the free headspace volume in the cultivation flasks as a way of restricting the oxygen availability. This was accomplished by simply changing the headspace to culture volume ratio and using flasks with or without baffles. Clearly, by restricting the oxygen uptake, cell cultures expressing VHb should thrive compared to those without. The procedure was advised after a long Skype meeting with Prof. Benjamin C. Stark, a very important figure within the field of biochemistry and development of VHb technology. Finally, cells were also grown with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to further stimulate the synthesis of porphyrins.

          <h3 class="section-heading">Growth curve analysis</h3>
          <p>
            In order to compare the growth rates between cells expressing different amounts of hemoglobin, cultivation experiments were carried out with samples taken at regular time intervals. The optical density was immediately measured by spectrophotometry. In total three controls were used: cells with no plasmid, with plasmid containing only the ribosome binding site R0010 (“empty plasmid”), and with a plasmid expressing only GFP. The control with an empty plasmid was used to make a fair comparison as the burden associated with a plasmid is twofold. First, the cell has to express the target proteins from within the plasmid. Secondly, the additional genes within the plasmid, such as the ones accounting for antibiotic resistance, need also to be expressed.

          <h3 class="section-heading">Proof of concept: Production of GFP </h3>

          <p>
            The principle behind our proof of concept experiment is simple: if VHb has an effect on the production of recombinant GFP, there should be an observable change in fluorescence intensity. The fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry. The advantage of this method over using a plate reader as in the InterLab study is that in flow cytometry, the fluorescence intensity is measured for each individual cell. This means that it is possible to determine whether effects of VHb on GFP production are caused by a change in overall cell density or a change within the individual cells. It also provides the additional advantage of giving much more exact information about the concentration of cells than what can be obtained by OD600.

          <h3 class="section-heading">Case study: Production of protein A</h3>
          <p>
            After screening the promoters using GFP, we wanted to select some of them for co-expression with a protein of industrial interest. We decided to go with protein A, an antibody-binding protein with many applications such as purification of therapeutic antibodies and various analyses involving antibodies.
            With protein A, we needed a different method of determining the yield rather than flow cytometry. We decided to use xx method to measure the concentration.

          <p>
            *Fermenters instead of flasks: Input from Magnus and from AZ. Can control oxygen level much better + measure e.g. pH continuously. It’s a better model of how it actually is in the industry. Something I think about density becomes more of a problem or something with the oxygen which is more realistic in a fermenter.
