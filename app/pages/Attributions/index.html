          <p>We would like to dedicate this page to all those who have helped and inspired us during the passing year, without whom this project would
          not have been made possible. As the first ever Lund team to compete in the iGEM competition, we were entering uncharted territory and it was
          much due to the patience of the institution that we managed to stay on course.</p>

          <p>The iGEM team was responsible for the design and execution of all presented activities unless otherwise stated.</p>
