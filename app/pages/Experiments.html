          <p>
            Science is an old and everlasting opportunity to learn more about nature, life and its components. In order to do this in a good way, knowledge is a prerequisite. The combined knowledge is always higher than for the individual. This means that the higher knowledge is reached if collaboration, comparison and competitiveness is present. Another very important factor is to replicate and compare results from one laboratory to another to verify and strengthen results an conclusions. In order to be able to make good comparisons ,exactly similar protocols will have to be used. Therefore a good documentation of what was used, in what quantities and how these are used, are of high importance.

            During the iGEM work-intense year 2018 a lot of different  hypotheses has been tested and compared. And to keep track of all of the protocols used, a document has been written containing materials, equipments and methods.
