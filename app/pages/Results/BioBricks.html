              The <em>Vitreoscilla</em> hemoglobin (VHb) biobricks were ordered from IDT as double-stranded, blunt-ended gBlocks. To insert them into plasmids, gBlocks and pSB1C3 were digested with the same restriction enzymes, ligated and transformed into <em>Escherichia coli.</em> Successful ligations were confirmed by colony PCR, restriction enzyme digestion and/or sequencing (GATC sequencing).

              After successful transformations, we performed SDS-PAGE (<i>fig. 1</i>). VHb has a molecular weight of 15.8 kDa, which is expected to be just above the second band of the ladder. The gel shows that all our transformations have a band with the expected molecular weight. However, we cannot confirm that it corresponds to VHb as the negative control also has a band with the same molecular weight. It is possible that there are other proteins expressed in <i>E. coli</i> of the same molecular weight, making the VHb difficult to discern. Due to these inconclusive results, we would have liked to perform a western blot analysis. However this wasn’t possible, as there are no commercially antibodies available for VHb. One way to confirm expression of the protein could be to express it with a His-tag, which would allow for purification, and then perform the SDS-PAGE.

              When expressing VHb, we found that addition of Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) increased the red color which is characteristic of hemoglobin (<i>fig. 2</i>). ALA is a precursor to heme, a ligand necessary for the function of hemoglobin. Bubbling the cultivations with carbon monoxide (CO), which is commonly done when expressing human hemoglobins, also increased the red color.

            <p>
              The growth curves (<i>fig. 3</i>) of the VHb composite BioBricks were analyzed to see if VHb expression had any effect on growth rate, final OD or lag time and if the promoter strength influenced this effect. The curves were analyzed through a statistical model-based approach where the Gompertz sigmoid was used to to estimate the growth rate.

            <p>
              Parameter estimates with a 95% confidence interval are shown in (<i>fig. 4</i>). For the final OD600, there was no significant difference between the constructs or compared to the negative control. The lag time or time to exponential growth was also determined to not be significant.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, there is a significant difference in growth rates at a level of 90% for all VHb-containing biobricks except K2602011 compared to the negative control. For K2602014 and K2602015, the effect was significant also on a 95% confidence level. Interestingly these two have the lowest promoter strengths, with the relative strengths 0.00 and 0.01, respectively. However, we have results suggesting that the expression level in 2014 is not 0, but that the promoter is in fact leaking to some extent. The implication of this is that a low level of VHb expression has a positive effect on the growth rate.

              It was further observed that the increase in growth rate was negatively correlated with increased promoter strength. It seems therefore that only a small amount of VHb is enough to enhance growth rate. The results also indicate that cells expressing VHb grow faster during the exponential phase and therefore reach stationary cell density faster than those without. However, while we were not able show an increased stationary cell density with statistical significance, we still believe the results may be of biological significance. We suggest more studies to be done in order to fully evaluate the effect of VHb.

            <b>Plasmid construction</b>
            <p>
              For the proof-of-concept we needed plasmids containing both a VHb biobrick and green fluorescent protein (GFP), for which we used the biobrick BBa_J364000. We tried three methods to assemble the constructs: 3A assembly, Gibson assembly and restriction enzyme cloning. In the end, biobrick BBa_K2602026 was  assembled through gibson assembly and biobricks BBa_K2602020, BBa_K2602021, BBa_K2602023, BBa_K2602024 and BBa_K2602025 were assembled  through restriction enzyme cloning.
            </p>

            <p>All the parts were confirmed with agarose gel electrophoresis (<i>fig. 5</i>). The size of the VHb-GFP gene is in total around 1.5 kbp. The left picture of <i>fig. 5</i> shows that the bands of the constructs are found slightly above the fifth ladder from bottom, which is around 1.5 kb. Though the bands are difficult to see in the figure, this was due to quenching caused by the high intensity of the other bands and they could be visualized by hiding those bands. Another confirmation, was proven by cutting the plasmid with <i>NotI</i> and gave the bands at around 1.5 kbp and 2 kbp. The constructs were also sent for sequencing, however only the construct BBa_K2602021 was confirmed through this method. The likely reason for this is use of sub-optimal sequencing primers. In total, six constructs of VHb-GFP were assembled and transferred into <i>E. coli</i> BL21 for co-expression.

            <b>Expression</b>
            <p>
              After successful transformations were confirmed, SDS-PAGE (<i>fig. 6</i>) analysis was performed to confirm the coexpression of both proteins; VHb and GFP. In the figure, from the second column from the left to right it is possible to observe the protein profile of the constructs with the following BioBricks: BBa_K2602020, BBa_K2602021, BBa_K2602023, BBa_K2602024, BBa_K2602025 and BBa_K2602026. VHb has a molecular weight of 15.8 kDa which is expected to be just above the second band of the ladder, while GFP has a molecular weight of 27 kDa which is expected to be just above the fourth band of the ladder. The gel shows that all our transformations have the bands with the expected molecular weights.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is important to highlight that no negative control was used, as our control strain also has a band with a molecular weight like one of VHb and therefore the confirmation of the expression of VHb should instead be done by its expression with a His-tag, which would allow for purification before performing the SDS-PAGE.
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>Finally, the expression of the VHb-GFP constructs were also confirmed by a physical inspection of the cell pellets of the constructs at the end of the cultivations. As can be appreciated in <fig. 7>,  the pellets exhibit a green color that is characteristic of the production of GFP.  Therefore is reasonable to declare that all the transformants were able to express GFP. </p>
