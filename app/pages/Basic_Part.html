<h1>Basic Parts</h1>

<p>
A <b>basic part</b> is a functional unit of DNA that cannot be subdivided into smaller component parts. <a href="http://parts.igem.org/wiki/index.php/Part:BBa_R0051">BBa_R0051</a> is an example of a basic part, a promoter regulated by lambda cl.
</p>

<p>Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are <b>many</b> opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. </p>

<h3>Best Basic Part Special Prize</h3>

<p>Most genetically-encoded functions have not yet been converted to BioBrick parts. Thus, there are *many* opportunities to find new, cool, and important genetically encoded functions, and refine and convert the DNA encoding these functions into BioBrick standard biological parts. To be eligible for this award, this part must adhere to <a href="http://parts.igem.org/DNA_Submission">Registry sample submission guidelines</a> and have been sent to the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. If you have a part you wish to nominate your team for this <a href="http://2017.igem.org/Judging/Awards">special prize</a>, make sure you add your part number to your <a href="http://2017.igem.org/Judging/Judging_Form">judging form</a> and delete the box at the top of this page.

<br><br>
<b>Please note:</b> Judges will only look at the first part number you list, so please only enter ONE (1) part number in the judging form for this prize. </p>

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>This page should list all the basic parts your team has made during your project. You must add all characterization information for your parts on the Registry. You should not put characterization information on this page. Remember judges will only look at the first part in the list for the Best Basic Part award, so put your best part first!</p>
