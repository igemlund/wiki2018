          <p>
            Recombinant hemoglobin based oxygen carriers (rHBOCs) may serve as potential blood substitutes. The advantages over human donated blood are numerous and include universal compatibility, longer shelf life, reduced risk of disease transmission as well as enhanced oxygen delivery. However, before becoming practically feasible, several properties of the hemoglobin needs to be tuned, such as reducing oxygen affinity and increasing stability without compromising other properties.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a part of this years modeling, we have set out to investigate the issue of reducing the oxygen binding affinity by QSPR modeling. In total, 143 functionally characterized hemoglobin mutants were obtained from the HbVar database and 2874 structural and physicochemical sequence based descriptors were generated from the PROFEAT server. The descriptors were subjected to three rounds of feature elimination, resulting in 151 remaining descriptors. The dataset was then subjected to a validation and model selection split, where the former was put aside for final validation and the latter was used to train the predictors. To avoid random bias, random forests, gradient boosted trees, support vector machines and logistic regressions were constructed 100 times in a 20 times repeated 5-fold cross validation. The performances were assessed in terms of accuracy and area under the receiving operator characteristic curve. The results were … for … and .. … for external validation when retraining the data on the entire model selection set.

            By investigating the gini coefficients of the descriptors, it was found  that …

            Finally, in order the evaluate the true performance of the model, mutants were generated and ordered ….
