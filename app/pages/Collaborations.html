            <p>After deciding to participate in the InterLab study as a criterion for the bronze medal, we realized that we did not have any Escherichia coli DH5-ɑ in our lab. Luckily, iGEM Chalmers in Gothenburg, Sweden, generously sent us a plate. </p>

            <p>
              iGEM DTU organized an inspiring and practical 3 day introduction to iGEM. We got to learn how to create BioBricks and attend different workshops which covered the iGEM registry, Interlab study, the importance of human practices and life after iGEM.  Abigail Sison from iGEM headquarters also held an informative session about iGEM, answering many of our questions regarding the requirements of the competition.

            <p>
              iGEM Vilnius-Lithuania organized a biohackathon on the theme “lab issues”, which we were happy to attend. The event took place on August 3-5 and was open not only to iGEM teams but to anyone interested in programming and lab work. We had a lot of fun and won third place with our software, a search engine for the iGEM distribution kit and for previous iGEM teams’ wikis.

            <h3 class="section-heading">Symposium</h3>

            <p>
              Together with iGEM Stockholm and iGEM Uppsala, we organized a symposium called Limits of Life, a one day event where two important topics were covered, burnout in academia and the ethics of biohacking and human augmentation. Read more about it <a href="">here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Along with the symposium event, we also collaborated with Uppsala regarding their handbook on stress management. We have been in contact throughout the entire process, discussing various topics related to the subject of burning out and stress. They did a great job outlining sources of stress and what one can do to avoid these issues. As such, we have included their handbook as an additional resource for further reading in our own handbook regarding project management in iGEM.

            <h3 class="section-heading">iGEM Linköping (LiU)</h3>

            <p>After a mail conversation with iGEM Linköping, Sweden, we realized it would be interesting to try combining our VHb constructs with their chaperone system. As a result, we decided to send them a small collection of our biobricks and they sent us some of their biobricks. Unfortunately we never had time to fully test their system but at least we managed to express it for validation.</p>
